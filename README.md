A repo for ECE4512 Senior Capstone Design 1

My name is Matthew Storey and I am a student at Mississippi State University working towards my Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering. My hobbies are playing guitar, building and painting miniature soldiers, cooking, and occasionally playing video games. My favorite book is The Lord of the Rings and my favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption. On weekends I like to hang out with my friends and play table top roleplaying games like Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons.
