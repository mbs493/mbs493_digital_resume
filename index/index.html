    <h2>Previous Job Experience</h2>
    <h3>First Baptist Children Center</h3>
    <p>I worked as an after school teacher and handyman throughout school semesters and during summer and winter breaks.
        I taught children of grades Kindergarten through 5th. During the summer camp program, 
        I was a councelor for recreational activities and was responsible for slideshow presentations.</p>
    <h3>Electric Guitar Project</h3>
    <p>Over the course of a summer, I dissassembled, rewired, and reassembled a pair of humbuckerpickups for an 
        electric guitar for personal use. This involved soldering, splitting wires in the humbucker that were incompatible 
        with the ones in the guitar, and addition of a Floyd Rose FRX Tremelo System.</p>
